# About the Game
Potentially Fire Pillars is the Obby Creator successor of my other tower-styled fangame, Total Fire Towers. Conquer a diverse range of towers, explore the depths of a burning world, and uncover the secrets that led up to this point.

This organization is used to host website files so I don't need to buy a domain on some unreliable host. This organization is managed by ImNotFireMan123 (@fire-roblox on GitHub), the owner of the fangame.
